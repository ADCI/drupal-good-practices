  - Always add **README.txt** file to your project. Use [README Template](https://www.drupal.org/node/2181737).
  - If your module creates any hooks or has an associated API, add examples of these hooks in a file named **modulename.api.php**.
  - Grant issue credits appropriately when maintaining a project.
  - Attribute authorship of provided by community patch by [adding a commit author](https://www.drupal.org/node/1146430) if applied with no or minimal changes.
  - You should not need to set [Closed (fixed)](https://www.drupal.org/issue-queue/status#closed) issue status yourself.
